                Human trafficking is modern day slavery and a $32 billion industry that exploits children, women and men. Victims of human trafficking are subjected through force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of sexual exploitation or forced labor. There are 27 million people enslaved worldwide. To learn more,

                So what do I do with human trafficking? Well, I'm an HT Analyst. I have worked the past 2 Superbowls and am signed up for the next two since they will both be in Florida. That entails going on sex sites and looking for signs of exploitation. But honestly, almost every woman on these sites is being exploited. So I compile data based on their sex ads and when available, I run it through a software that we have that will search for other ads from the same user or same photos.

                I also spend a lot of time on sex buyer message boards, looking for hints of girls who were less than enthusiastic during their "encounter". I look for patterns of travel and for signs in their pictures that they are under someone else's control. Then I send it along to whichever law enforcement agency is running point.

                Another way I assist in anti-trafficking is through my work on cold cases with the Anti-Predator Project. I take on cases of missing girls pro-bono, and try to use all my analytic skills to find out what happened. Most times, I don't succeed in finding the girl...but I do succeed in finding and getting surveillance on the traffickers who have moved on to others girls. Some of the girls' cases are girls that we know are long dead. And sometimes in the course of working a new case, I find new victims and things can move pretty quickly.
